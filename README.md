Brites de Almeida, known as the **Baker of Aljubarrota (Portuguese: Padeira de Aljubarrota)**, is a legendary figure and Portuguese heroine whose name is associated with the victory of the Portuguese, against Castilian forces, at the Battle of Aljubarrota in 1385.

After their defeat in the Battle of Aljubarrota, the Castilian soldiers in flight were attacked and killed by the local inhabitants. According to the story, seven or eight of them found shelter at Brites' bakery, which was empty because she had gone out to help to kill the soldiers. On her return she found the door closed and suspected the presence of enemies. She found the men hiding in her baker's oven and killed them with a shovel. She then cooked them in the oven along with the bread.

Although it is undeniable that the story was a legend, Brites de Almeida came to be celebrated by the Portuguese in their songs, traditional stories and this game and her deeds have remained as a symbol of Portugal's independence.
