Welcome to **Padeira de Aljubarrota**, a game made in HTML using the Phaser engine. This project represents my first attempt at game development and animations.

## About the Game:
In this game, you take on the role of Brites de Almeida, also known as the **Baker of Aljubarrota**, a legendary figure and Portuguese heroine. Your task is to protect the bakery from incoming enemies using your Baker's Shovel. Survive the round, and you emerge victorious!

### Background:
Brites de Almeida's name is associated with the victory of the Portuguese against Castilian forces at the Battle of Aljubarrota in 1385. After the battle, Castilian soldiers in flight sought shelter at Brites' bakery. Upon her return, suspecting the presence of enemies, she found the soldiers hiding in her baker's oven and dispatched them with a shovel. This legendary tale has been celebrated in Portuguese culture, songs, and traditional stories, serving as a symbol of Portugal's independence.
